# Summary
Configuration files for my Linux installation.

I used to use AwesomeWM for a while. Shortly after I began, I realized that TWM's aren't for me. My favorite Linux DE's are Cinnamon and Gnome.

I use Neovim for coding and editing text. I am inside the shell on WSL pretty much all day.

Lately I am using Windows for everything, with WSL. I realized I could do everything I wanted just fine on Windows. WSL2 feels just like actual Linux, and I use that for all my shell needs, using the Windows Terminal, which is actually really good.

I use Ubuntu WSL but I use the Nix package manager for installing programs. Nix has the most impressive list of updated programs on their repositories that I've seen.
