# Summary
Configuration files for my Linux installation

I use Arch. I love Arch. Not for the memes, I swear.

I used to use AwesomeWM for a while. Shortly after I began, I realized that TWM's aren't for me. My favorite DE's are Gnome and Cinnamon. Currently using Cinnamon. It's so cute.

I use Neovim for coding. Although recently, having to use Windows for work, I've been using Clion and VS Code (with their respective Vim bindings plugins, of course).

I code everything in Rust, unless I really have to use something else. I really love Rust with a passion.
